Foundry REST API provides various API endpoints for fetching and interacting with your foundry world data through a node.js server that act as a relay.

## **Getting started guide**

To start using the Foundry REST API, you need to -

- Have an API key or have the relay server running on your local machine or at an address your foundry game can access.
    
- Have the URL of that server (and port if running locally) set as the "WebSocket Relay URL" in the settings for the Foundry REST API module.
    
- Have your API key in the module settings.
    
- Each request must have the your API key in the "x-api-key" header.
    
- Endpoints other than /clients require a clientId parameter that matches a connected world.
